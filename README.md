# betterloxd


## Note on csvParsing 
There are multiple types of files that might want to be parsed with different information in them (like, the diary has rewatches, tags, whereas ratings is simpler). For clarity, this is the order of betterloxd objects. A future fix might warrent creating a class with proper constructors, but that is for later 
1) Position 
2) Title 
3) Year 
4) URL
5) Rating  
6) Watched Date (if applicable)
7) Description
